# Starting Setup
I have the following equipment:
* WandererCover V4-EC Professional Flatpanel
* Celestron EdgeHD 800 with 0.7 reducer and Off-Axis-Guide and a Dew Heater
* ASIAir Plus
* ZWO ASI585MC (main) and ZWO ASI220M (Guide)
* ZWO Autofocuser
* ZWO Filter Wheel
* Sky Watcher EQ6-R Pro

So all equipment can be conviniently controlled by the ASIAir Plus, except the Wanderer Cover...
(To be fair: The Cover can be controlled by a series of power on/off cycles via the ASIAir - but this is a more a pain, than a feature)
I have a small Windows Tablet to control it - but this is overkill, just to open/close the cover and adjust the brightness.

So target of this project is to have a small standalone unit to control everything onsite via local controls (e.g. buttons)
